## Standards compliance

The following list presents the most known standards, protocols, data stores, formats, and so on, *that ARINT system can use and is compliant with*.

!!! note "Standards update"
    Also verify your system version and update it as new standards can be included in official package releases.

>The order of items is not relevant (meaning that it does not pursue a specific objective). Also classification made is not *an exact one* as some items can be categorized in more places. If someone know exactly what standard is looking for, a traversal of the entire list is best option.

<!-- -#TODO here to talk about what can be done through services (see Programing Examples `https://zato.io/en/docs/3.2/dev/examples/index.html`) 
    WHAT SHOULD BE HERE:

* ARINT is a platform that has alreaby built in: `IN channels`, `OUT channels`, `CLOUD connections`, `SCHEDULER definitions`, and so on, generally things useful to interface with other systems
* ARINT allows to write *service* to make useful transformations by using prevoiusly enumerated things
* ARINT solution package has already build in the following services:
    * xxx...
    *  xxx...

More details about [what is included in ARINT package will be found on "Licensing editions" document](./130.04-Licensing_Editions_Pricing.md)
