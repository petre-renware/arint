## Introductory

### General rules and recommendations

* New "user or client or implementation" level business objects `code-name` should start with character `Z`. Any other ARINT objects do not use `Z` as first character in code-names, so this can make an *acceptable separation of those objects that are subject of change by sysyem updates* and is a *guarantee that objects starting with `Z` in code-name will not be altered* by any system update.



### Namespaces catalog

Here are listed the main *area of objects* defined in *System database*. These are the equivalent of a `namespace` (or `schema` in relational databases terminology) and they will become in a way[^1] a *`prefix`* for all entities / objects contained in.

* **URRM** user roles and rights management
* **ODEF** business objects definition
* **MADA** global master data (cross any systems, applications, nodes, ie global for an **ARINT instance**)
* -#TODO...

## Notes and remarks

[^1]:
    (`PROPOSAL @ 230823 by piu`): The way that concrete entities / objects are prefixed depends of database, ORM instrument used, etc. To keep as agnostic as possible this prefix will be used as *object name prefix* followed by `_` character. **All `code-name`s for a prefix will be kept in 4 characters**.
