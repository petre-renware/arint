# Core-Integrator System Overview



***Table of contents:***

[TOC]

***



**ALPHAREN Core Integrator** (aka **`ARINT`** or **`arint`**) system is a framework product for automation, integration and interoperability between _distributed systems_ or _data sources_ basically aimed to build _API oriented_, _middleware_, _frontend_ and _backend_ applications.

Practically it allows to create small-footprint and focused *business oriented microservices* or to transform "monolith" applications to micro-applications that will act *as a single one* but with a high degree of *maintenability*.

Product is available as *distinct software* or as *ready to run appliance* (including also some built-in components such as an internal database for business operations).

It acts as a high level *Service BUS* (ie, ESB or ESOA) to connect different micro-services and to make them to work ***as one***. As example it is used for almost all *RENware Software Systems* products. Of cours6 it can be used for **CUSTOMER SYSTEMS and SERVICES** too.






***ARINT*** very general and generic process flow is: 

``` mermaid
graph TD
    SRV[[Service]]
    RSRV[[Repetitive \n Service]]
    EXT([External system])
    INCH{{IN channel}}
    EDB[(external \n databases)]
    IDB[(own internal \n database)]
    OUTCH{{OUT \n channel}}
    CALLBCK([callback endpoint])
    LOGFILE[(actions \n log file)]
    
    EXT -->|call| INCH
    INCH --> SRV
    INCH --> RSRV
    SRV --> OUTCH
    RSRV --> OUTCH
    
    OUTCH <-.-> EDB
    OUTCH <--> IDB
    OUTCH --> |notify| CALLBCK
    OUTCH --> |logging \n actions| LOGFILE

```




## Fundamental features

* **ANYWHERE**. can work even the systems that must be integrated are in different non routable LANs (address systems at `http` protocol level)

* **ANYHOW**. is agnostic to format, composition, structure, encoding of information required / provided by systems that must be integrated

* **ANYTIME**. can work as a distributed high scalable cluster of "**ALPHA-REN Integrator Machines**"

* **SECURED**. can work with any public standard (ie, defined at least as `RFC`) of Internet security

## Typical use cases

***ALPHAREN CORE-Integrator*** is used for enterprise, business integrations, data science, IoT and other scenarios that require integrations of multiple systems.

Real-world, production ***ALPHAREN CORE-Integrator*** environments include:

* A platform for processing payments from consumer devices

* A system for a telecom operators integrating CRM, ERP, Billing and other systems as well as applications of the operatorâ€™s external partners

* A data science system for processing of information related to securities transactions (FIX)

* A platform for public administration systems, helping achieve healthcare data interoperability through the integration of independent data sources, databases and health information exchanges (HIE)

* A global IoT platform integrating medical devices

* A platform to process events produced by early warning systems, (ex SAP EWS)

* Backend e-commerce systems managing multiple suppliers, marketplaces and process flows
B2B platforms to accept and process multi-channel orders in cooperation with backend ERP and CRM systems

* Platforms integrating real-estate applications, collecting data from independent data sources to present unified APIs to internal and external applications

* A system for the management of hardware resources of an enterprise cloud provider

* Online auction sites

* E-learning platforms

* ad-hoc data API for databases, protecting them to direct access
