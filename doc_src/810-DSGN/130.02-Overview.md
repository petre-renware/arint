## Fundamental features

* **ANYWHERE**. can work even the systems that must be integrated are in different non routable LANs (address systems at `http` protocol level)

* **ANYHOW**. is agnostic to format, composition, structure, encoding of information required / provided by systems that must be integrated

* **ANYTIME**. can work as a distributed high scalable cluster of "**ALPHA-REN Integrator Machines**"

* **SECURED**. can work with any public standard (ie, defined at least as `RFC`) of Internet security
