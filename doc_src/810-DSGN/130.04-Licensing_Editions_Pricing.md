## Introductory

### Components

The licensing relevant components are:

This component assure all routes listening and http request decoding, data formats and conversions, http response preparation, internal scheduler, and so on, keeping all of these in compliance with all enumerated standards, protocols, data formats, etc in document [Product Features](./810.46-Product_Features.md)

* the **Databases** that come as built-in ARINT. This databases (data stores) keeps all system data required in all operations execution (see document [System Data and Objects](./810.03-System_Data_and_Objects.md))

* all **ARINT CORE** that represents the:
    * *administration interface* for all ARINT CORE specific data, processes, operations, schedules, system logs analyzer
    * *services code* (programs) of all operations that ARINT is able to execute (found in all end user and administration manuals)

### Services

Also a set of associated services is relevant. A set of **minimal services** is:

    * *infrastructure level* services: product installation, operating system preparation, install different other requirements, users management, etc

    * *ARINT basic configuration* representing the services that assure the minimal ARINT configuration in order to start and being able to respond to ezternal systems requests and being able to complete address its own databases (read, write, update, delete...)

There are also more other possible services. The *minimal services set* assure only a right installation and basic system functioning. Supplementary services can include:

* infrastructure tuning in customer specific environment
* system configuration to some basic customer specific information (like name, location, basic domain and ARINT server name, etc)
* more configuration services that are subject to a dedicated project (or project work package)
